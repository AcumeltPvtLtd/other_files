NAMING CONVENTION USED IN THE ERP HAS THIS BUG.

FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAVE AND MADE ITEM NAMED 
[ITEM-CASTING-ID] <- FOR EXAMPLE
AND IF WE CREATE  TWO ANOTHER ITMES RELATED TO SIMILAR NAME 
LIKE 
[ITEM-CASTING-ID-CORE] & [ITEM-CASTING-ID-CORE-PAINT] 

THERE IS HUGE POSSIBILITY THAT ONE OF THE ITEM WILL NOT BE LISTED ,AVAILABLE OR SEEN AT BOM [BILL OF MATERIALS ] WHEN MAKING A NEW ONE  WHEN ADDING IN [Raw Materials
] OR [ Manufacturing BOM] 
}
